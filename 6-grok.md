## System Integration and Validation Plan for BARLI-QM Experiment

### 1. Introduction

The BARLI-QM experiment aims to compare reward processing and potential subjective experience correlates between biological systems (rat pleasure circuits) and artificial systems (AI agents with simulated and optionally quantum-enhanced pleasure circuits). This plan outlines the integration of hardware and software components and the validation processes to ensure the system operates as a cohesive, real-time, closed-loop framework. It builds on the experimental design by specifying technical implementation steps, performance benchmarks, and troubleshooting protocols.

### 2. Objectives

*   **Objective 1:** Integrate biological, artificial, and interface components into a functional closed-loop system with <10ms latency.
*   **Objective 2:** Validate system performance against predefined metrics for neural recording, stimulation, AI learning, and data analysis.
*   **Objective 3:** Establish protocols for troubleshooting and contingency planning to maintain experimental integrity.

### 3. System Architecture

The BARLI-QM system comprises four main subsystems:

*   **Biological System (BS):**
    *   Rat brain regions: Medial Forebrain Bundle (MFB), Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA).
    *   Hardware: Neuropixels probes (1024 channels), optogenetic stimulation (470nm lasers).
    *   Data: Neural activity (LFPs, spikes), behavioral responses.
